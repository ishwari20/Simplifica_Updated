<p class="p1">Well, life as a Law Student is quite hectic, we are sorrounded by heaps of books.
From old age laws to latest amendments we must know it all.
Going to college, attending lectures, completing assignments, doing internship makes the day fly quickly.
Participating in moot courts, doing research day and night,finding relevant case laws,making memorials, touching deadlines and finally submitting it.
Wearing that black and white attire for the first time. Walking in pride through the campus and bit of excitement and nervousness in the heart says it all.</p>
<p>Still, I remember my first walk through moot court. It was barely a distance of 10 steps from seating area to the podium. That walk was the longest walk of my life.
Well, summing up its a great and a proud feeling to be a law student.
It becomes quiet hectic sometimes but as say saying goes ‘you never grow in your comfort zone’.
Law school is a roller coaster ride, so fasten your seat belt and enjoy the ups and downs and surely you will reach the destination with a smiley face.</p>
<p> the best part of studying law is that it has various interesting subjects and knowing the law and order is so much of a necessity in a place like India.
It is a bit difficult to study 8–10 hrs a day and also knowing current affairs simultaneously but it's worth doing.
Getting a lot of opportunity to debate, give presentations, participating in moot competitions is a boon. You can imply your knowledge in almost all scenario and drafting your own article and presenting it, which becomes like a credential after course completion.</p>
<p> after pursuing <a href="https://www.shiksha.com/ll-b-chp">LLB</a>we can opt for masters in law that is <a href="https://collegedunia.com/courses/master-of-laws-llm">LLM</a>or opt for other <a href="https://www.bmu.edu.in/social/career-path-after-llb-india/">CAREER OPTIONS</a> like advocate,government services,legal advisor,teacher,etc </p>
