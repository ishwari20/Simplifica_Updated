        <p class="p1">5 years of MBBS college can be very hectic and tough.we just dont study for ourselves but on our knowledge a persons life is dependent.so it can be a lot of pressure , but the will and compassion to become a doctor is what keeps
          the
          person going.medical college is about practicals and theory both and how to apply the theorotical knowledge to real life in extream pressure.along with fun life of college the bulk load of theory and practicals teaches us the essence of
          time management and stress full life. but the satisfaction at the end that we will be doctors keeps us going.</p>
        <p>Also When you go home you receive special attention from your parents and relatives Whenever you meet someone and say I am doing MBBS the look of Respect on that person's face you see is priceless .There is a lot of stress of studies
          especially before the examinations and its more in the practicals as the procedures and other things can be learnt easily You have a huge syllabus to cover each day… In class, you can only get about 40 % of the things being taught (in
          general.. In a few classes you may get more) and most of your day is spent in college.</p>

        <p class="p1">After graduation comes the time for post graduation and getting ready to become a doctor finally. but even after completing the course and getting the degree it takes years to make a name for yourself. years of selfless service and with out a break is what a doctors life is.  late night shifts and to continous 40 hours of service for other and their well being.  </p>
        <p>doctors are the most self devoted people who often forget to think about others and work for the betterment of society. there are number of <a href="https://ucnedu.org/pg-medical-courses-to-be-considered-after-mbbs/"> post graduation courses</a> that can be done after pg.
