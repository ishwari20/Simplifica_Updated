# Simplifica
Many young students are often confused as to what career would be the best for them. Often this results in them getting into fields which they don't enjoy working in. All this due to poor advice. With Simplifica, we aim to solve that problem. Simplifica asks the student a few simple questions, aimed at getting to know what the student is like as a person. Then the algorithm analyzes the data collected and comes up with a career field that would best suit that student. Also, Simplifica provides a one-stop shop solution for the students' information needs, as we have curated information pages with the relevant links, related to all career choices.

We hope that students can take a wise and informed decision with Simplifica!
